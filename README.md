## Emergency Medicine - Notes Template ##

This provides you with a static HTML page with copy-and-paste template notes for Emergency Medicine cases.

I use this when working in Emergency Departments that have text-only computerised notes. I simply load up the web page, draft my notes in one of the multiline text boxes, then paste it into the computerised system.

This page is not capable of saving anything, so no risk of leaking patient notes. Refreshing the page clears anything you've entered.

The "Bloods condenser" is a simple tool to get around the character limit of old fashioned text-only systems. If you paste textual blood results into the left side and hit the button, it'll give you a condensed version on the right with consecutive spaces reduced to one space.

Use at your own risk.
